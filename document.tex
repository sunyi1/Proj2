I think simulated annealing would be better. Restart hill climbing will be better than just hill climbing, but restart hill climbing will take longer because of restart times. In my opinion, hill climbing algorithm is a kind of greedy algorithm. Imagining we are in a mountain. Because hill climbing always go down, if the curve in the mountain go up. The hill climbing will stop going. Therefore, if we restart hill climbing a couple of times, maybe we can get smartest number. 
We can use restart to solve hill climbing problem. Simulated annealing is a way to get global minimum approximate number. In my opinion, because simulated annealing is using a probability number to choose each step, I think simulated algorithm is better than hill climbing which is local optimize.
